# Equation-Solver
This program was created to make doing homework easier. The program has a number of different settings and features enabling users to select formulae under subject subheadings that the program is designed to solve. 

Under the Physics subcategory, users can perform calculations having to do with Kinematics, Power, Ohm’s Law, and Harmonics. Within chemistry users will be able to perform Stoichiometry calculations, and solve the Ideal Gas Law. Under math students have the option to use the Quadratic Formula, find the Area and Circumference of a circle, and the Area of a triangle based on the side lengths (Heron’s Formula). 

This program takes user input data, and automatically calculates endpoint data. The user inputs data, and indicates unknown, absent, or constant variables with the alphabetic characters ‘u’, ‘a’, and ‘c’. The Windows Form based code then interprets, and calculates all possible data.  The program is user-friendly, versatile, and robust. This program will change homework taking for years to come!
